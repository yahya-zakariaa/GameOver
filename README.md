# GameOver
This website was built using 'HTML', 'CSS', and 'JavaScript', along with 'Vanilla JS' and 'Bootstrap' for responsiveness across different devices without redoing styles, which saved time. 'Git' and 'GitHub' were used for tracking changes, and an API was used to get game-related info. I faced issues with the API not supporting game searches, so I added a basic algorithm to make it work.
